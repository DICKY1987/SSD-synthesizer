# üìò Comprehensive System Documentation Template (Extended for Trading/AI Systems, v2)

## 1.0 System Overview & Architecture
### 1.1 Purpose and Scope  
Automated trading system that converts economic calendar events into actionable MT4 signals; imports CSV, enhances with anticipation events and equity market opens, monitors in real time, and generates signals for MT4/Excel integration.

### 1.2 Architectural Diagrams (C4, component, network)  
 

### 1.3 Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)  
Downloads/Import ‚Üí Raw Calendar Sheet ‚Üí Processed Events ‚Üí Enhanced Events (anticipation + equity) ‚Üí Chronological Sort ‚Üí Final Display ‚Üí Strategy Execution ‚Üí Signal Entry ‚Üí MT4 Transfer ‚Üí Trade Execution.

### 1.4 Stakeholders & Responsibilities  
 

### 1.5 Trading Philosophy & Strategic Approach  
Event-driven signals from economic events, anticipation events (default 2 h pre-event, configurable 1/2/4 h), plus equity market open events (Tokyo 21:00 CST; London 02:00 CST; New York 08:30 CST). Performance-based parameter selection and integrated risk management.

## 2.0 Data Models & Persistence
### 2.1 Logical Data Model (entities, attributes, relationships)  
Calendar events (title, country, impact, dates, status, quality scores), trading signals (export tracking), system status (health).

### 2.2 Physical Database Schema (tables, types, constraints)  
SQLite with UPSERT using natural keys (title, country, event_date, event_time); indexing for status and trigger_time queries; transaction/context management.

### 2.3 State Management & Persistence Rules (sessions, caches, lifecycles)  
Status/health tracking via system status table; event lifecycle status; signal export tracking with metadata.

### 2.4 Data Retention & Archival Policies (compliance, cleanup, backups)  
Automated backups (timestamped naming), retention policies, validation and recovery procedures.

### 2.5 Terminal-Specific Persistence Mechanisms  
 

---

## 3.0 Interfaces & APIs
### 3.1 API Specifications (REST, gRPC, design principles)  
FastAPI web app with REST endpoints and WebSocket updates.

### 3.2 Detailed Endpoint Contracts (inputs, outputs, permissions)  
 

### 3.3 Function-Level Contracts (internal libraries/modules)  
 

### 3.4 Integration Points (external APIs/services consumed)  
Multi-source calendar imports (ForexFactory, Investing, DailyFX).

### 3.5 Communication Contracts (Runtime Bridges)  
Real-time WebSocket broadcasting with client state management and reconnection; error handling and message queuing; health check systems.

### 3.6 Signal Queueing & Ordering Guarantees  
Processed events sorted chronologically before export.

### 3.7 Legacy Integration Modules  
Excel/VBA calendar management; MT4 integration via standardized EA-compatible CSV export.

## 4.0 Core Logic & Behavior
### 4.1 Business Logic & Algorithms (descriptions/pseudocode)  
Pipeline: Import ‚Üí Impact filter (High/Medium) ‚Üí Time zone standardization (CST) ‚Üí Country mapping ‚Üí Categorize ‚Üí De-dup ‚Üí Add anticipation/equity events ‚Üí 15-sec monitoring ‚Üí Trigger (‚àí3 min configurable) ‚Üí Strategy ID (RCI) ‚Üí Parameter set selection (tiers) ‚Üí Risk-adjusted adjustments.

### 4.2 Error Handling & Exception Strategy (error catalog, logging, recovery)  
Multi-level logging; retry with exponential backoff; circuit breaker patterns; component health/status monitoring and error escalation.

### 4.3 Edge Case Specifications (invalid inputs, boundaries)  
Past/future window validation (past tolerance 1 day; future range 14 days); weekend blocking; timezone-aware scheduling.

### 4.4 Embedded Annotations (Code Comment Layer for devs)  
 

### 4.5 Safety Controls  
Emergency stop/resume; emergency pause triggers; trading embargo windows (e.g., 60 min before / 30 min after high-impact events).

### 4.6 Adaptive Reentry Logic  
Risk score (0‚Äì100; base 50) drives parameter adjustments; risk tiers (Emergency/Recovery/Conservative/etc.); weighted smoothing (e.g., 60/40) and signal-strength scaling with risk.
