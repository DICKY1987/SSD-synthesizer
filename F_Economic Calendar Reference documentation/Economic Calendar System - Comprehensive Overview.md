Economic Calendar System - Comprehensive Overview
The Economic Calendar to Signal System is a sophisticated automated trading system that converts economic calendar events into actionable trading signals for MT4 integration. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:
üéØ System Purpose
The system automatically:

Imports economic calendar data from CSV files
Processes and enhances events with anticipation signals
Monitors events in real-time
Generates trading signals based on economic events
Integrates seamlessly with existing MT4-Excel trading infrastructure

üèó Core Architecture Components
1. Data Acquisition Layer
Downloads Folder ‚Üí File Detection ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Import ‚Üí Storage
Automated Import Schedule:

Primary: Every Sunday at 12:00 PM CST
Retry Logic: Hourly attempts for 24 hours if import fails
File Patterns: Searches for ff_calendar*.csv, *calendar*thisweek*.csv, *economic*calendar*.csv
Validation: File freshness, size checks, content validation

2. Data Transformation Pipeline
Raw CSV ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí Standardize ‚Üí Enhance ‚Üí Sort ‚Üí Display
Processing Steps:

Impact Filtering: Only keeps High (Red) and Medium (Orange) impact events
Time Zone Conversion: Standardizes all times to CST
Currency Standardization: Maps countries to trading pairs
Event Categorization: Classifies event types for strategy mapping
Duplicate Detection: Prevents duplicate events from multiple sources

3. Event Enhancement Engine
Original Events ‚Üí Anticipation Generator ‚Üí Equity Markets ‚Üí Final Queue
Anticipation Event Generation:

Creates "anticipation" events before major announcements
Default: 2 hours before each high/medium impact event
User Configurable: Can set 1h, 2h, 4h anticipation windows
Naming Format: "2 hours before NFP anticipation - USD - High impact"

Equity Market Integration:

Automatically adds market opening events:

Tokyo Open: USD/JPY at 21:00 CST
London Open: EUR/USD at 02:00 CST
New York Open: USD pairs at 08:30 CST



4. Real-Time Monitoring Engine
15-Second Timer ‚Üí Event Detection ‚Üí Trigger Logic ‚Üí Signal Generation
Event Monitoring:

Frequency: Checks every 15 seconds for upcoming events
Trigger Timing: Events trigger 3 minutes before scheduled time (configurable)
Event Types: Economic events, anticipation events, market opens

üîÑ Signal Generation Process
Strategy ID Assignment
Uses a 5-digit Regional-Country-Impact (RCI) system:
[R][CC][I] Format:
R = Region (1=N.America, 2=Europe, 3=Asia-Pacific, etc.)
CC = Country Code (01=USA, 02=EUR, 03=GBP, etc.)
I = Impact (1=Medium, 2=High)
Example: 21102 = Europe (2) + EUR (11) + High Impact (2)
Parameter Set Selection
Performance Oscillator (0-100) ‚Üí Parameter Set (1-4) ‚Üí Trading Parameters
Performance-Based Selection:

0-25: Conservative (Set 1: 0.01 lots)
26-50: Moderate (Set 2: 0.02 lots)
51-75: Aggressive (Set 3: 0.03 lots)
76-100: Maximum (Set 4: 0.04 lots)

Risk Management Integration
The system includes sophisticated risk management:
Risk Score Calculation:
Base Score: 50
- Drawdown adjustments (last 4h, 12h)
- Consecutive loss/win streaks  
- Time to next major event
- Market volatility factors
- Equity market close proximity
Parameter Adjustments:

Lot Size: Reduced during drawdown periods
Stop Loss: Tightened during high volatility
Entry Distance: Increased during uncertain periods
Trading Windows: Blocked around major events

This system represents a comprehensive solution for automated economic calendar-based trading, combining sophisticated event processing with robust risk management and seamless MT4 integration.Retryff_calendar_thisweek.csvcsvDThis is the website where the economic calendar is generated I've attached a copy of the CSV file after it's downloaded and a screenshot showing where the CSV button is on the web page Is it possible to create a solution that downloads this automatically without user interaction creates the anticipation events and equity market events and delivers CSV economic calendar that contains The high and medium economic as well as the anticipation an equity market open events ready for the system to start trading without us interaction https://www.forexfactory.com/calendarEditEngineered automated solution for downloading economic calendar eventsThe user is asking about creating a fully automated solution that:

Downloads the economic calendar CSV automatically from ForexFactory (https://www.forexfactory.com/calendar)
Creates anticipation events
Creates equity market events
Filters for high and medium impact events
Delivers a ready-to-use CSV that contains all processed events
Does this without any user interaction

This is essentially asking for a web scraping/automation solution that would:

Navigate to the ForexFactory calendar page
Click the CSV download button
Process the downloaded file
Apply all the transformations from their economic calendar system
Output the final processed CSV

Let me think about the technical approaches:

Web Automation Approaches:

Selenium WebDriver (Python/JavaScript)
Playwright (Python/JavaScript/C#)
Puppeteer (JavaScript)
Requests + BeautifulSoup (Python, but might not work if the download requires JavaScript)


Challenges:

ForexFactory might have anti-bot measures
The CSV download might require JavaScript interaction
Rate limiting
Website structure changes over time
Authentication/CAPTCHA requirements


Integration with existing system:

The user already has a sophisticated economic calendar system
Need to integrate this automated download with their existing processing pipeline
Need to match the exact CSV format they expect



Let me search their project knowledge to understand their current CSV processing and see what format they expect.Yes, absolutely! Based on your existing Economic Calendar System architecture, I can create a fully automated solution that downloads the ForexFactory calendar, processes it, and delivers a ready-to-trade CSV.

A sophisticated processing pipeline

Looking at the CSV file they provided (ff_calendar_thisweek.csv), it has the exact format their system expects:

Title, Country, Date, Time, Impact, Forecast, Previous, URL

The user wants a completely automated solution that:

Downloads the CSV from ForexFactory automatically (without user interaction)
Processes it through their existing pipeline
Adds anticipation events and equity market events
Outputs the final ready-to-trade CSV

I can create a web automation solution using Python with Selenium or Playwright that will:

Navigate to forexfactory.com/calendar
Click the CSV download button
Wait for download to complete
Process the file through their existing pipeline
Generate the final CSV with all enhancements

This would integrate perfectly with their existing system and can be scheduled to run automatically.Perfect!
